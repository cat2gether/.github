### What is cat2gether?  
[cat2gether is global, fully free and open-source dating and meeting app](https://cat2gether.com) designed for geeks, nerds and curious minds.  
Unlike traditional apps, We focus on what you **love**<!-- we love cats -->, not how you look.

### Our Features

- Worldwide availibility. (except for UK and Australia) 
- Security. Our chats are end-to-end encrypted. Your identity is protected by nicknames and avatars until you are ready to share it with someone.
- Match by interests not appearance. You can't see names or photos of people until you both agree for that.  
- Rare in-app features. (e.g. Markdown, Code snippets, cat2fetch, etc.)  
- Easter eggs, achievements, badges, and other features encouraging people to use cat2gether.
- Multiple modes for connecting with people. (e.g. Dating, Looking for group)
- Recomendations by interests, universes, fandoms, coding languages, forums, etc.
